% Use MATLAB to generate three figures based on the recorded data from Exercise 3:
% 
%     A plot the X and Y location of your turtle. Save this file as matlab/pose_xy.png
%     A plot of the heading angle (Theta) of your turtle as a function of time. Save this file as matlab/pose_theta.png
%     A quiver plot showing the location and heading of the turtle.  Save this file as matlab/pose_quiver.png
% 
% Following the Working with rosbag Log Files example, develop a script called plotbag.m and put it in a directory of your package called matlab.  Your script will need to do the following...
% 
%     Load the myturtle.bag file
%     Select the messages on the turtle1/pose topic
%     Convert these pose messages to a timeseries
%     Generate the figures.  (Make sure to include labels and titles for your figures.)

% Create a bag file object with the file name
% by omitting the semicolon this displays some information about
% the bag file
bag = rosbag('../data/myturtle.bag')
 
% Display a list of the topics and message types in the bag file
bag.AvailableTopics
 
% Since the messages on topic turtle1/pose are of type Twist,
% let's see some of the attributes of the Twist message
msg_pose = rosmessage('turtlesim/Pose')
showdetails(msg_pose)
 
% Get just the topic we are interested in
bagselect = select(bag,'Topic','turtle1/pose');
 
% Create a time series object based on the fields of the turtlesim/Pose
% message we are interested in
ts = timeseries(bagselect,'X','Y','Theta','LinearVelocity','AngularVelocity');
